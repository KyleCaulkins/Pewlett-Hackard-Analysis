# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

Pewlett-Hackard is a large company, with thousands of employees. As baby boomers begin to retire Pewlett-Hackard needs to know who is retiring, how many are retiring, and from what departments they are retiring. A large wave of retirements has the potential to leave a company in an uncompetitive position if handled incorrectly. The purpose of this analysis is to help future-proof Pewlett-Hackard and allow the company to properly prepare for the upcoming vacancies. The following analysis was performed in conjunction with Pewlett-Hackard human resources department as part of the employee research effort.

## Results

A significant part of the retirement analysis is a request to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This information will be used by stake holders within Pewlett-Hackard to help smooth the transition within the company's workforce. The following bulleted list highlights four of the major findings from the analysis. Detail of the code used for the analysis can be found

* Finding 1

![retiring_titles](/Queries/retiring_titles.png)

The number of employees that are likely to retire is significant, especially in the senior roles. The senior engineers and senior staff positions are large contributors to the company, and also have the largest counts in likely retirements. These two roles should be prioritiezed in vacancy mitigation.   

* Finding 2

Only two managers were found to be in the likely to retire category. This raises a flag to look further into how the data was gathered. Management is typically a more senior role and to only have two retiring requires further questioning. Do most managers not have "Manager" in their titles? If the titles do not include the word manager, but the role does require leading others, how can we target these individuals? Are the managers actually younger than many of the engineers and staffers? If so, maybe a bigger question needs to be asked about company culture and why our senior members are not advancing to management roles? This is possibly a significant finding and requires more investigation.
